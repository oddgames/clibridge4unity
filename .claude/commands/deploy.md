Deploy clibridge4unity: increment version, build, push, release, and verify installation.
Do NOT stop to ask for confirmation — run the entire pipeline automatically.

## Arguments
- `/deploy` — Patch bump (e.g. 1.0.6 → 1.0.7), build, push, release, verify
- `/deploy minor` — Minor bump (e.g. 1.0.6 → 1.1.0)
- `/deploy major` — Major bump (e.g. 1.0.6 → 2.0.0)
- `/deploy build` — Build and release ONLY (no version bump, use current version)
- `/deploy check` — Dry run: show what would change, don't modify anything

## Step-by-step procedure

### 1. Read current version and calculate new version
- Read `clibridge4unity/clibridge4unity.csproj` `<Version>` and `Package/package.json` `version`
- If they differ, WARN the user and ask which to use
- Calculate new version based on bump type (patch/minor/major)
- If argument is "check", show what would change and stop

### 2. Bump version in ALL files (skip if "build")
Use the Edit tool to update the old version → new version in each file:
1. `clibridge4unity/clibridge4unity.csproj` — `<Version>X.Y.Z</Version>`
2. `Package/package.json` — `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
3. `Package/Editor/Core/BridgeServer.cs` — `public const string Version = "X.Y.Z";`
4. `CLAUDE.md` — `# UPM manifest (vX.Y.Z)`
5. `Package/CLAUDE.md` — `# UPM manifest (vX.Y.Z)`
6. `SUMMARY.md` — `Current: X.Y.Z`
6. `install.ps1` — `.\install.ps1 -Version X.Y.Z`

### 3. Quick doc check
Verify these are up to date (only edit if actually wrong):
1. `CLAUDE.md` commands section — must list ALL bridge commands including flags (--inspect, --trace, etc.)
2. `CLAUDE.md` CLI-side commands — must list WAKEUP, DISMISS, SCREENSHOT, SETUP, UPDATE
3. `SUMMARY.md` — command count must match actual
4. Run `grep -c "BridgeCommand" Package/Editor/Commands/**/*.cs` to count actual commands

### 4. Write release notes to `.claude/RELEASE_NOTES.md`
Before running the script, write a human-readable changelog to `.claude/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.
The deploy script reads it, attaches it to the GitHub release, then BLANKS the file (so the
next deploy doesn't reuse stale notes). If you skip this, the release body falls back to a
file-diff dump — useless for downstream readers.

Format:
```markdown
## vX.Y.Z

### New
- Bullet points of new features / commands / flags

### Fixed
- Bullet points of bug fixes (root cause + symptom)

### Internal
- Refactors, perf, deploy/CI tweaks
```

Recall what changed in this session (the work the agent did right before /deploy) and write
that. Don't dump the file diff — describe behavior changes.

### 5. Run the deploy script
The script handles: build → verify version → package → git commit+push (`git add -A` so all
edits ship) → tag → release → upload → verify → update local CLI.

```bash
python .claude/scripts/deploy.py X.Y.Z
```

If the script fails, STOP and report the error.

## Important rules
- Do NOT stop to ask for confirmation — run the full pipeline end to end
- The csproj `<Version>` is the single source of truth
- After pushing, the UPM git URL (`#vX.Y.Z`) automatically resolves to the new tag
